# Task 1 
Internship on Data Science 
# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset provided by the Scikit-learn library contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which are used as features for classification.

## Dataset
The dataset provided by Scikit-learn consists of 150 samples, with each sample representing an iris flower. Each sample includes the following measurements:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

Additionally, each sample is labeled with the corresponding iris species.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: We will explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
3. **Model Selection**: We will experiment with different machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
4. **Model Training**: We will train multiple models using the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Model Evaluation**: After training, we will evaluate the models' performance on the test dataset to select the best-performing model.
6. **Model Deployment**: Once the best model is selected, we can deploy it to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements.
